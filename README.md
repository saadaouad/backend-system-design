# Backend System Design

Notes on designing backends that stay up, stay fast, and stay honest about trade-offs.

This is not a catalog of every database or protocol. It is a way to think: scope the problem, model the system, then choose storage, scale, security, and async work to match the requirements.

There is no perfect system. There is a system whose trade-offs fit the problem.

## How to read this

1. **Start with the system.** Inputs, outputs, boundaries. Then the usual parts: client, server, load balancer, database, cache.
2. **Write requirements before architecture.** CAP, quality attributes, and non-functionals decide the design. The stack comes later.
3. **Draw the high-level shape.** Entities, APIs, protocols.
4. **Scale and store on purpose.** Vertical vs horizontal. Replication, partitioning, caching, estimates.
5. **Protect the pipe and the caller.** TLS termination is not auth. Authentication is not authorization.
6. **Keep expensive work off the request.** Queues, workers, then a video upload as a worked example.

## What’s inside

| Section | What it’s for |
| --- | --- |
| [Everything Is a System](/02-everything-is-a-system/01-what-is-a-system) | See the whole machine, not just the database |
| [Requirements](/03-requirements/01-core-elements-of-system-design) | Scope, CAP, quality |
| [High-Level Design](/04-high-level-design/01-modeling) | Entities, APIs, protocols |
| [Scaling](/05-scaling/01-vertical-vs-horizontal-scaling) | Bigger machine vs more machines |
| [Data Storage](/06-data-storage/01-data-storage-overview) | SQL, NoSQL, copies, caches, numbers |
| [Security](/07-security/01-termination) | HTTPS at the edge, who you are, what you can do |
| [Asynchronous Workflows](/08-asynchronous-workflows/01-asynchronous-tasks-&-components) | Set it and forget it |
| [Wrapping Up](/09-wrapping-up/01-what-we-learned) | The three things to keep |

Start simple. Write the assumptions down. Copy data when one machine is not enough. Do not wait on a 4GB transcode.
